**Title: Reliable Uplink Synchronization Maintenance for Satellite-Ground Integrated Vehicular Networks: A High-Order Statistics-Based Timing Advance Update Approach**

**Abstract:** Satellite-ground integrated vehicular network can provision ubiquitous and unlimited network connectivity for massive vehicles, and is expected to play a vital role in 6G-supported intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, due to its high-dynamic channel environments and limited satellite payload, the uplink synchronization has become a major bottleneck to restrict vehicular communication performance. Focusing on maintaining reliable uplink synchronization, we propose an efficient timing advance (TA) update approach in this paper. Specifically, an enhanced preamble format is first presented based on the periodical pairing sounding reference signals (SRSs), which enables the satellite to continuously track uplink timing variation with a low signaling overhead. By taking full advantage of all the fourth-order autocorrelation produces from the received preamble, we further design a novel timing metric consisted of the correlation and differential normalization functions, which is capable of having a considerably increased correlation length and shaper mainlobe, as compared to the existing ones. Through theoretical performance analysis, it is indicated that the proposed approach not only notably promotes class distance between the correct and wrong timing indexes, but also can achieve the immunity to multi-path effect and large carrier frequency offset (CFO), while having a reduced computational complexity. Simulation results in a typical low-earth-orbit (LEO) scenario reveal the superiority of our approach in terms of the false alarm probability, the missed detection probability, as well as the timing mean square error.

**Title: ICRA: An Intelligent Clustering Routing Approach for UAV Ad Hoc Networks**

**Link:** [doi.org/10.1109/tits.2022.3145857](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/tits.2022.3145857)

**Journal:** IEEE Trans. Intell. Transport. Syst.

**Abstract:** As an important means of obtaining information of marine situation, the marine monitoring system relying on UAV has been paid more and more attention by all countries in the world, and the demand for tasks is growing continually. In UAV ad hoc networks, routing protocols with immutable routing policies that lack flexibility are generally incapable of maintaining effective performance due to the complicated and rapidly changing environmental situation and application requirements. In this paper, we propose an intelligent clustering routing approach (ICRA) for UANETs. The ICRA is composed of three components: the clustering module, the clustering strategy adjustment module and the routing module. In the clustering process, each node needs to calculate its utility. In order to maintain high topology stability and long network lifetime in different network states, the reinforcement learning based clustering strategy adjustment module needs continuous learning the benefits brought by adopting different strategies to calculate the nodes utility in a specific network state. With the learned knowledge, clustering strategy adjustment module could determine the optimal clustering strategy according to the current network state. In the routing phase, the proposed scheme can reduce the end-to-end delay and improve the packet delivery rate by introducing inter-cluster forwarding nodes to forward messages among different clusters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify ICRA’s robustness and superiority over existing schemes. The results demonstrate that ICRA could achieve better performance than its state-of-the-art counterparts with regard to the clustering efficiency, topology stability, energy efficiency and quality of service.

**Journal:** IEEE Trans. Intell. Transport. Syst.

**Abstract:** Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have huge potential for a variety of military and civilian uses, such as intelligent transportation system, smart city, and so on. The 6th Generation (6G) communication technology is expected to provide 3-Dimensional (3D) wireless coverage and greatly improve the performance of UAV networks. The UAV-to-UAV (U2U) message exchange (or message exchange for short) is an important basis of multi-UAV cooperation. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAV networks, the U2U messages (or messages for short) are vulnerable to both the external and internal attackers. In this work, we propose a Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange (LTME) scheme for UAV networks by efficiently aggregating the cryptography and trust management technologies. In the LTME scheme, a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS) periodically updates the reputation levels of registered UAVs (or UAVs for short) and securely distributes secret values to the UAVs. Based on the received secret values, each trustworthy broadcasting UAV can generate its encrypted messages so that only trustworthy receiving UAVs can decrypt them, and each trustworthy receiving UAV can accurately judge whether the received messages and the corresponding broadcasting UAVs are trustworthy in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, we present a simplified LTME (sLTME) scheme and conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation for the LTME and sLTME schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can provide rich functionality and strong robustness with low computation and communication overheads, and are significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.

**Link:** [doi.org/10.1109/tits.2021.3122994](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/tits.2021.3122994)

**Journal:** IEEE Trans. Intell. Transport. Syst.

**Abstract:** The huge amount of data produced in the 6G networks not only brings new challenges to the reliability and efficiency of mobile devices but also drives rapid development of new storage techniques. With the benefits of fast access speed and high reliability, NAND flash memory has become a promising storage solution for the 6G networks. In this paper, we investigate a protograph-coded bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative detection and decoding (BICM-ID) utilizing irregular mapping (IM) in the NAND flash-memory systems. First, we propose an enhanced protograph-based extrinsic information transfer (EPEXIT) algorithm to facilitate the analysis of protograph codes in the IM-BICM-ID systems. With the use of EPEXIT algorithm, a simple design method is conceived for the construction of a family of high-rate protograph codes, called irregular-mapped accumulate-repeat-accumulate (IMARA) codes, which possess excellent decoding thresholds and linear-minimum-distance-growth property. Furthermore, motivated by the voltage-region iterative gain characteristics of IM-BICM-ID systems, a novel read-voltage optimization scheme is developed to acquire accurate read-voltage levels, thus minimizing the decoding thresholds (in dB) of protograph codes. Analyses and simulations indicate that the proposed IMARA-aided IM-BICM-ID scheme and read-voltage optimization scheme remarkably improve the convergence and decoding performance of flash-memory systems. Thus, the proposed protograph-coded IM-BICM-ID can be viewed as a reliable and efficient storage solution for the new-generation mobile networks, such as Internet of Vehicles.

**Journal:** IEEE Trans. Intell. Transport. Syst.

**Abstract:** With the growth of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems (IATS), a huge volume of data is exchanged between vehicles in these newly developed infrastructures. As a result, the requirements of securing data exchange between vehicles, autonomous or otherwise, have also increased tremendously. Securing data transfer and keeping a record of each transaction becomes a necessity in IoV/IATS. In this paper, we propose some optimized security algorithms using symmetric encryption for secure multimedia data transfer between vehicles. The main feature of these optimized algorithms is that they use a lower amount of data to generate fingerprints. The algorithms convert approximately <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$3.7 \times 10^{5}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> samples of data into 3600 samples to generate the fingerprint. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to fetch the highest three peak values of the signal in the frequency domain. A centralized server authenticates the data transfer by comparing the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$HASH$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of the fingerprints and also keeps the transaction record. Through experimental analysis, the performance of proposed algorithms is confirmed by achieving reduced size samples to generate fingerprints and their authentication at the server-side.

**Title: Best of Both Worlds: Ex Ante and Ex Post Fairness in Resource Allocation**

**Link:** [doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.2432](https://www.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.2432)

**Journal:** Operations Research

**Abstract:** Consider the problem of allocating indivisible goods among agents with additive valuations, where monetary payments are not allowed. When randomization is allowed, it is possible to achieve compelling notions of fairness such as EV, which states that no agent should prefer any other agent's allocation to their own. When allocations must be deterministic, achieving exact fairness is impossible but approximate notions such as EV up to one good can be guaranteed. In “Best of Both Worlds: Ex Ante and Ex Post Fairness in Resource Allocation,” H. Aziz, R. Freeman, N. Shah, and R. Vaish ask whether it is possible to achieve both types of guarantees simultaneously. More specifically, they ask whether there exists a probability distribution over deterministic allocations such that every deterministic allocation is envy-free up to one good and the distribution is exactly envy-free in expectation. The main result of the paper answers this question in the affirmative, showing that ex ante and ex post fairness need not be in conflict.

**Journal:** Operations Research

**Abstract:** Regret minimization has gained popularity in a wide range of decision-making problems under uncertainty because of its capacity to identify more opportunistic solutions than worst-case value optimization. Unfortunately, the rigidity of current worst-case regret models and scarcity of tractable solution methods have been serious obstacles in multistage applications. In “Risk-Averse Regret Minimization in Multistage Stochastic Programs,” M. Poursoltani, E. Delage, and A. Georghiou consider a multistage stochastic programming setting with a discrete scenario tree. They introduce the notion of the Δ-regret model, which bridges between the ex ante and ex post regret minimization paradigms that are currently used in the regret minimization literature for single-stage problems. The notion of Δ-regret minimization is investigated for the first time both theoretically and numerically in order to better understand its behavior under a set of popular risk measures.

**Abstract:** The gig economy open a new business model in which services have access to a large pool of workers that are compensated based on their actual production, which can be useful to operate at lower levels of utilization to improve response times to customers. However, having a large pool of workers with low utilization may lower their motivation and increase employee turnover, which can hurt productivity in the long run. “Balancing Agent Retention and Waiting Time in Service Platforms” looks at this tradeoff and provides a data-driven approach to manage worker capacity in on-demand service platforms, showing evidence through a real-world application of an outbound call center with freelance agents.

**Title: New Algorithms for Hierarchical Optimization in Kidney Exchange Programs**

**Journal:** Operations Research

**Abstract:** New Exact Approaches Tailored for Kidney Exchange Programs with Hierarchical ObjectivesKidney exchange programs increase the rate of living donor kidney transplantation. Whereas effective integer programming models aimed at maximizing the total number of transplants have been proposed in the literature, these cannot always be extended to handle a hierarchy of objectives, which is often a requirement in practice. In “New Algorithms for Hierarchical Optimization in Kidney Exchange Programs,” Delorme, García, Gondzio, Kalcsics, Manlove, and Pettersson introduce a new integer programming framework to solve large-size instances of kidney exchange programs. The authors use an ad hoc preprocessing and a reduced-cost variable fixing algorithm to dramatically decrease the size of the models, and they devise a diving algorithm that exploits the hierarchical structure of the problem to significantly reduce the number of integer programs that need to be solved. They also show that it is possible to transition between models as different layers are traversed in the hierarchy, allowing each layer to be solved with the most effective model. Experiments on three different European kidney exchange programs show that running times can be reduced by up to three orders of magnitude.

**Title: Customized Dynamic Pricing When Customers Develop a Habit or Satiation**

**Link:** [doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.2412](https://www.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.2412)

**Journal:** Operations Research

**Abstract:** In Dynamic Pricing with Customer State Dependence, Wen Chen, Ying He, and Saurabh Bansal discuss optimal prices that a firm should offer to customers who develop a habit or satiation from consumption. At a high discount (or equivalently a lower price), a habit-prone customer will purchase a large amount in a current period. The firm will earn a low revenue per unit on the amount bought by the customer in this period. However, this large purchase will also create a stronger habit in the customer that the firm can exploit in the future periods. At a low discount, the firm will earn a higher per unit revenue in this period. However, the lower purchase quantity will also result in a weaker habit in the customer for the future periods. This tradeoff exists in every period. These effects are reversed for a satiation-prone customer. Using an analytical model, the authors determine the optimal profit-maximizing dynamic prices that a firm should offer to such habit- or satiation-prone customers. The results are robust for various specifications for habit formation, and yet in each specification they are obtainable tractably.

**Journal:** Operations Research

**Abstract:** Dial M for SimulationFor years, systems of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) were simulated by discretization, inevitably introducing a bias, which can be difficult to quantify accurately. To circumvent this, some attempts have been made to simulate exactly various models from the SDE solution. These approaches prove capable of producing accurate results. A serious drawback of such an approach, nevertheless, is the implicit need to use extensive numerical methods, which make the entire simulation computationally heavy and quite impracticable. In the paper “Unified moment-based modeling of integrated stochastic processes,” Kyriakou, Brignone, and Fusai present a methodological framework based on M(oments) for the simulation of such models that overcomes earlier limitations. Theoretical results and extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed approach allows accurate simulation of complex stochastic models with low computational effort.

**Title: Using Machine Learning to Include Planners’ Preferences in Railway Crew Scheduling Optimization**

**Date:** 2023-01-18

**Link:** [doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2022.1196](https://www.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2022.1196)

**Journal:** Transportation Science

**Abstract:** In crew scheduling, optimization models can become complex when a large number of penalty terms is included in the objective function to take planners’ preferences into account. Planners’ preferences often include nonmonetary aspects for which both the mathematical formulation and the assignment of appropriate penalty costs can be difficult. We address this problem by using machine learning to learn and predict planners’ preferences. We train a random forest classifier on planner feedback regarding duties from their daily work in railway crew scheduling. Our data set contains over 16,000 duties that planners labeled as good or bad. The trained model predicts the probability that a duty is perceived as bad by the planners. We present a novel approach to replace the large construct of penalty terms in a crew scheduling optimization model by a single term that penalizes duties proportionally to the predicted probability of being assessed as unfavorable by a planner. By integrating this probability into the optimization model, we generate schedules that include more duties with preferred characteristics. We increase the mean planner acceptance probability by more than 12% while only facing a marginal increase in costs compared with the original approach that utilizes a set of multiple penalty terms. Our approach combines machine learning to detect complex patterns regarding favorable duty characteristics and optimization to create feasible and cost-efficient crew schedules.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2022.1196 .
