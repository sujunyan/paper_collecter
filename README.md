# Paper Collecter

## What is this?
This is a paper collector to collect a list of journal papers from good venues.

## Why do I need this?
Previously I use RSS/Researcher-app to get the updated list of paper, but they have certain drawbacks. So I want to design my own.

## How do I use this?

## Folder structure
meta/: store the metadata of the collected papers.
donelist.txt: a list of DOIs that I have finished reading or not interested.
